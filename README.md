# Home SOC Lab

In this project, I created a basic home SOC lab in the cloud (Microsoft Azure).

I want to express my gratitude to Josh Madakor for his excellent tutorial on setting up a basic Cybersecurity SOC home lab in the cloud using Microsoft Azure. Configuring and running this lab greatly improved my understanding of setting up a virtual environment. To deepen my knowledge, I analyzed and deconstructed the setup multiple times, reinforcing my foundational skills. After several repetitions, I challenged myself to build the lab without referring to the tutorial, further solidifying my expertise.

# Here is a high-level summary of the home SOC lab
- Set up a honeypot VM to attract attacks.
- Analyze failed login attempts using Event Viewer.
- Forward logs to Microsoft Sentinel for log aggregation & querying.
- Use GeoIP enrichment to identify attack origins.
- Create an attack map to visualize threats.

Here is a picture of the attack map for the honeypot.
